This is a simple admin dashboard layout made using HTML and CSS Grid. 
The page is divided into four sections: a header at the top. 
. A sidebar on the left for navigation where it has home,users and settings.
. A main content area on the right.
. And a footer at the bottom.
 The grid layout helps organize the content neatly on the page, making it clean and neat.
