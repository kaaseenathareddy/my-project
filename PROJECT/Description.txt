Project Title
Blockchain Document Integrity Verifier

Description
A web application that proves whether a document is original or tampered.
It stores a document’s unique hash (digital fingerprint) on the Ethereum blockchain.
The actual file stays off-chain; only the hash is stored to ensure security and trust.


Purpose / Core Use
To verify the authenticity of important documents.
To ensure no one can edit, fake, or modify a document without detection.
Provides tamper-proof proof of existence and ownership.

Real-Time Usage
Used to verify certificates, mark sheets, and degrees.
Used for legal documents like agreements, contracts, and property papers.
Ensures business audit and compliance records are not modified.
Helps artists and creators prove ownership of digital art or intellectual property.
Can store medical records securely for future verification.

Technology Stack
Blockchain: Ethereum (Ganache local test network)
Smart Contract: Solidity
Backend: Node.js with Express
Blockchain Integration: Web3.js
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose
Frontend: React (with Axios)

Step-by-Step Project Flow
Install required tools: Node.js, React, Ganache, Truffle.
Write a simple Solidity smart contract to store and read document hashes.
Deploy the smart contract to Ganache to get a contract address.
Build the Express backend and connect it to MongoDB and the blockchain.
Integrate Web3.js in backend to interact with the smart contract.
Create API endpoints to register a document hash and verify it.
In the React frontend, compute the document hash (SHA-256) before uploading.
Build UI to upload, register, verify documents, and show proof details.

How to Run (Short & Simple)
Start Ganache (local blockchain).
Deploy contract using Truffle.
Start backend server with Node.
Start React frontend.
Open browser → upload → register → verify documents.
