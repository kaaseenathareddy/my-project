This project demonstrates how to build an interactive product filtering system on a web page using JavaScript DOM manipulation. The page contains a product list (e.g., shoes, shirts, gadgets) along with a dropdown menu that allows the user to filter products by category.

When the user selects a category from the dropdown.

Only the products belonging to that category are displayed.

If the user selects "All", every product is shown again.

The filtering happens instantly without reloading the page, making the experience smooth and dynamic.

This task helps in understanding:

How to use HTML to create a structured product list and dropdown menu.

How to use CSS to make the product list visually appealing.

How to use JavaScript to.

Access and manipulate the DOM elements.


dynamically update visible content based on user input.
