Title

REST API for Playing Card Collection Using Express.js

Description

This project involves building a RESTful API with Express.js to manage a collection of playing cards. The API provides endpoints that allow clients to perform common operations such as:

Listing all cards

Adding a new card (with properties like suit and value)

Retrieving a card by its ID

Deleting a card by its ID

The card data is stored in an in-memory array, making the system simple and easy to understand without needing a database. The project emphasizes the use of RESTful principles, proper use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE), and returning structured JSON responses.
